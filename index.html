      <h2> <strong>Biography and Goals</strong> </h2>
      <p> I was born and raised in the small island of Guam on 1985. <br>
        Throughout the years I have been exposed to a laid back <br>
        family-oriented lifestyle.
      </p>

      <p> My parents moved from Korea post Vietnam War and started up a <br>
        construction company as the opportunity presented itself due <br>
        to the military build up at the time. They raised three kids (myself <br>
        included), two boys and one girl.
      </p>

      <p> In 2003 I moved to Seattle to attend the University of Washington for <br>
        my bachelors. And then back to Guam in 2008 after the recession hit and <br>
        was unable to find a job. In 2012 I moved to Hawaii for opportunity, but <br>
        while the sun and beaches were fun to enjoy I found my life stagnating. <br>
        That is why I decided to join <strong>Code Fellows</strong> for an opportunity to pursue <br>
        a meaningful life time career.
      </p>

      <p> My goals are to become a <em>top-notch coder</em> through the help of <strong>Code <br>
        Fellows</strong> and be able to make my folks proud of the career I've developed.
      </p>
